# odin-sign-up-form

In this project, I constructed the front end side of a sign-up form for a sort of cult/conspiracy. Why? Why not?

The meager bit of Javascript is embedded in the html, the CSS could perhaps use a tidy up but overall I'm fairly pleased for a night's work.

I opted not to put in any client side validation for the telephone number, since the format differs significantly from nation to nation.

Cheers, Ant.
